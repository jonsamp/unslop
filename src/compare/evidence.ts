/**
 * Evidence-basis comparison (SPEC §16.6 — plan `pl-43c5` step 6, trellis-bd0c).
 *
 * Compatibility is evaluated **per measurement** over the recorded analysis
 * identity (§16.2) — never per whole report, and never by assuming a core
 * version alone establishes comparable evidence. Each provider carried on
 * either side gets its own verdict:
 *
 * - **Producer semantics** — provider identity (pinned tool/adapter version,
 *   mode, provider options), the parser that read the inputs, and the
 *   normalized analysis options. A change here is a different measurement:
 *   the provider's evidence is `noncomparable` with a reason per changed
 *   component — never diffed into fictitious improvement/regression or
 *   new/resolved finding churn.
 * - **Scope semantics** — the selected source sets and file paths (never
 *   the content fingerprints). A changed selection is a different analysis
 *   (§16.6 input/config identity): `noncomparable`, never silently trended.
 * - **Content provenance** — the selected files' fingerprints. A revision
 *   change is the *expected input* of a comparison: the evidence still
 *   compares, with an explicit `input-revision-changed` caveat on external
 *   entries so the diff is read as the revision, not a measurement change.
 *
 * Absence is explicit, never a failure: a provider not carried on a side
 * (or carried `unrequested`) reads as `unrequested` there — never as a
 * regression, an `unavailable` failure, or resolved-finding churn. A
 * pre-provider (schema 1.0.0) report carries no analyses at all, so every
 * provider on the other side reads as not carried there.
 *
 * Diffs are computed only for **external** entries carrying measured output
 * (namespaced metrics/findings inside the entry) and only when both sides
 * are `complete` with identical producer and scope semantics — partial or
 * absent evidence is never diffed. Native entries never duplicate the
 * report's own metrics/findings (§6.6): their entry verdict is the
 * recorded-identity view, while their values are diffed by the scored-basis
 * comparison (`compare.ts`), which this evidence verdict never fragments.
