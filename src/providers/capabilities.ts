 * Supported-provider capability metadata (SPEC §16.1/§16.2/§16.7 —
 * `trellis-db3e`, plan `pl-43c5` step 25).
 *
 * The static, typed record of the external quality-evidence providers
 * trellis knows — so a provider request can be validated as *known*
 * configuration before any adapter exists (SPEC §16.2/§16.3; unknown ids
 * are operational errors) — together with the capabilities each is
 * contracted to own and the support status of those capabilities today.
 * This is metadata, not a runtime: no adapter, resolution, or execution
 * lives here. Adapter-owning steps update their entry when they deliver;
 * request surfaces read the recorded status and reason so a not-yet-
 * delivered or gated capability is reported truthfully as `unsupported`,
 * never as a clean result (§16.2).
 *
 * The SonarJS entry carries the recorded distribution and metric-interface
 * decision (`docs/sonarjs-decision.md`, SPEC §16.7): the outcome is
 * explicitly **deferred**, so a `sonarjs` request resolves to `unsupported`
 * with the recorded reason — visible, policy-testable, never a claimed
 * implementation.
 *
 * Scoring (SPEC §16.5) is structurally recorded: every entry pins
 * `unscored: true` as a schema literal, so this metadata cannot declare a
 * scored capability or a new scoring weight without a schema change — which
 * is the point.
