/**
 * Fleet provider-scope tests (SPEC §11 + §16, plan `pl-43c5` step 20 —
 * trellis-f3e5). The fleet is a thin orchestrator: every target folds its own
 * `runWorkspaceAudit` call with its own configuration, so per-target provider
 * selection, staged views, scratch and evidence must be isolated by
 * construction. These tests prove that against the real core on real temp
 * workspaces:
 *
 * - a target requesting a provider carries its own namespaced evidence and
 *   still deep-equals an independent audit of the same workspace;
 * - a native-only target stays byte-identical to a native-only audit and is
 *   never affected by a neighbor's provider evidence, unavailability or
 *   failure (criterion: absence never erases evidence or moves a score);
 * - required-evidence policy failures and provider configuration errors roll
 *   up through the existing fleet 0/1/2 contract (`assessFleet`), drift
 *   staying separate;
 * - trellis-owned scratch is cleaned for every target even when another
 *   target fails (the fleet is sequential — bounded concurrency of one — so
 *   targets can never share or race on a scratch path);
 * - opt-in history keeps provider evidence advisory (step 8): adding a
 *   provider between recorded runs never fragments the compatible baseline.
 *
 * The pinned-jscpd cases skip (never fabricate) where the pinned tool is not
 * installed on the host; the located-`unsupported` SonarJS capability covers
 * the evidence-carrying paths on every host.
